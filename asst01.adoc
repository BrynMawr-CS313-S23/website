**Due Thursday, January 26, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Build and write a simple interactive application
* Repond to user key and mouse events
* Write a C++ program 
* Use std::vector
* Work within a 2D coordinate system

= Description

In the file, `drawer.cpp`, implement a drawing program. 

* Support a circle brush type
* Support multiple brush sizes (no smaller than size 1)
* Support multiple colors with a pallette (at least three) 
* Support transparency
* Clear an image

NOTE: Your program will use a simple API based on openGL and GLFW. link:https://alinen.github.io/tinygl-cpp/html/functions.html[Click here to see the documentation].

= Build

Fork the repository at https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS313-S23/blobilism into your 
own repository.

Clone the repository to your own machine and follow the directions in the README 
to build.

NOTE: Don't forget to do an "out of source" build and run `cmake ..` from the `/build` directory!

You are given basecode for this assignment. When you run the basecode, you should see the following image.

= Requirements

* Your program should accept the following *key input*
** The 'c' key should clear the canvas. 
** The 'UP' key should increase the brush size
** The 'DOWN' key should decrease the brush size. The brush size should not be allowed to go smaller than 1.
** The 'RIGHT' key should decrease the transparency. The transparency should go no smaller than 0.
** The 'LEFT' key should increase the transparency.
* You program should have *circle buttons* for changing the current color 
** Check whether the user clicked inside any of the pallet buttons. If yes, change the current color to the pallet button's color.
* When the user moves the mouse, you should store the current size, color, and (x,y) coordinate in a vector. (Hint: Use a struct or class to store this information together)
* Your program should follow the course link:styleguide.html[style guide].
* *DON'T FORGET* to update the README! 

= Hints

*Computing distance*

To check whether the user clicks a pallette circle, compute the distance between 
the current mouse position and each of the circles in your pallette. Recall that 
the distance between two points a and b is

d = \sqrt{(ax - bx)^2 + (ay - by)^2}
