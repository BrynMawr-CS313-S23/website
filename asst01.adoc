= C++ warm-up 

If you're used to programming in Java, modern C++ will be similar. Let's write some basic 
C++ programs to get our bearings.

Fork the repository at link:https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS312-2021/cpp-warmup[cpp-warmup]. 
Complete the programs and push them back to github.

If you have questions about using github and programming in C++, we will have
a git/C++ workshop during our first lab on February 18th, at 2:30pm.
