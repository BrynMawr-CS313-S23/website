**Due Thursday, January 26, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Build and write a simple interactive application
* Repond to user key and mouse events
* Write a C++ program 
* Use std::vector
* Work within a 2D coordinate system

= Description

In the file, `src/blobilism.cpp`, implement a drawing program. 

* Support a circle brush type
* Support multiple brush sizes (no smaller than size 1)
* Support multiple colors with a pallette (at least three) 
* Support transparency
* Clear an image

NOTE: Your program will use a simple API based on openGL and GLFW. link:https://alinen.github.io/tinygl-cpp/html/functions.html[Click here to see the documentation].

= Build

Fork the repository at https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS313-S23/blobilism into your 
own repository.

Clone the repository to your own machine and follow the directions in the README 
to build.

NOTE: Don't forget to do an "out of source" build and run `cmake ..` from the `/build` directory!

[source]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:<username>/blobilism.git
$ cd blobilism
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make (or start blobilism.sln)

You are given basecode for this assignment in `src/blobilism.cpp`. 
When you run the basecode, you should see the following image.

= Requirements

* Your program should accept the following *key input*
** The 'c' key should clear the canvas. 
** The 'UP' key should increase the brush size
** The 'DOWN' key should decrease the brush size. The brush size should not be allowed to go smaller than 1.
** The 'RIGHT' key should decrease the transparency. The transparency should go no smaller than 0.
** The 'LEFT' key should increase the transparency.
* You program should have *circle buttons* for changing the current color 
** Check whether the user clicked inside any of the pallet buttons. If yes, change the current color to the pallet button's color.
* Draw a circle whenever the user moves the mouse with the left-mouse button pressed. To implement this feature, store the current size, color, and (x,y) coordinate in a vector whenever the mouse moves. (Hint: Use a struct or class to store this information together. Add the information in response to the "mouse move" event)
* Your program should follow the course link:codingstandard.html[coding standard guide].
* *DON'T FORGET* to update the README with images that you've made with your program! 

Please feel free to customize your drawer! Some ideas

* Choose your own pallette colors
* Implement a unique brush. Although the draw API only supports circles, rectangles, and triangles, you can combine them to make different shapes.

= Hints

*Computing distance*

To check whether the user clicks a pallette circle, compute the distance between 
the current mouse position and each of the circles in your pallette. Recall that 
the distance between two points a and b is

d = \sqrt{(ax - bx)^2 + (ay - by)^2}

= Submit your work

*Submission checklist:* 

* Compiles on unix (test on a lab machine or goldengate.cs.brynmawr.edu).
* Updated README (All "todos" should be replaced with your work!)
* Pushed to github

To push to github, make sure you add and commit your local changes and then push to Github.
