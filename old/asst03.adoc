= {title}

**Due Thursday, April 8, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Implement a raytracer containing a unique set of features
* Implement materials, such as lambert, phong, metals, glass
* Implement different primitive types, such as spheres, planes, triangles, and boxes
* Implement one or more unique scenes

= Getting started

Fork the repository at https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS312-2021/raytracer

Follow the instructions in `Readme.md` to build and run the code.

If you have already forked this repository, update your 
repository with the original repository.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
git remote add source https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS312-2021/raytracer.git
git fetch source
git merge source/main
----

You may already have a script, `update.sh`, which performs the above steps.

= Getting started

Our raytracer basecode is based on the architecture in 
link:https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html[Ray tracing in one weekend].
Read this book to understand the classes and utilities included with your basecode.

Your basecode uses the link:https://github.com/g-truc/glm/blob/master/manual.md[GLM math library] 
for vectors, points, and colors (all have type glm::vec3)

Your base code also uses the ppm_image class to save your output to a PNG file.

== Lecture demos

Make sure that you can build and run the examples from lecture.

*gradient* 

image::A03/gradient.png[]

*silhouette*

image::A03/silhouette.png[]

*normals*

image::A03/normals.png[]

== Basic raytracer

Look at file, `basic.cpp`. This program implements a simple raytracer that 
supports lambertian materials using the architecture 
from link:https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html[Ray tracing in one weekend].
This architecture defines classes for

* ray 
* camera
* hittable
* hittable_list
* material
* sphere

When you run this program, you should see:

image::A03/basic-empty.png[]

Notice that the basecode implements the following features

* Spheres (section 5, 6.13)
* Antialiasing  (section 7)
* Gamma correction (section 8.22)

You can improve the quality of the final image by modifying the parameters
`samplers_per_pixel` and `max_depth` used by the raytracing algorithm.

After you implement the lambertian material (probabilistic method from section 8), you 
should see the followng

image::A03/basic.png[]

= Intersections

Your basecode already implements sphere intersections in `sphere.h`. Modify the 
function `sphere::hit` to use the geometric intersection test from lecture. 
Note that this architecture uses a `hit_record`, passed by non-const reference, 
to store the hit information, rather than just return time t.

In the file, `intesection_tests.cpp`, we have included tests to help you debug 
your intersection tests. 

To run your tests from bash (mac)
[source,sub=quotes]
----
raytracer/build> ../bin/intesection_tests
----

To run your tests from bash (windows)
[source,sub=quotes]
----
raytracer> ../bin/Debug/intesection_tests
----

Implement *at least two* additional primitives from the following list

* Planes (Implement `plane::hit` in `plane.h`)
* Triangles (Implement `triangle::hit` in `triangle.h`)
* Boxes (Implement `box::hit` in `box.h`)

Update `intesection_tests.cpp`to test your code. Make sure you have at least 4 tests

* A ray outside the primitive, which hits the object 
* A ray inside the primitive (hits)
* A ray outside, pointing towards the primitive that misses
* A ray outside, pointing away from the primitive (misses)

= Materials

In the file, `materials.h`, implement different materials. 

**Requirements**

* Phong shading model (Implement `phong::scatter`)
* Metal (section 9 - implement `metal::scatter`)
* Glass (section 10 - implement `dielectric::scatter`)

Test your materials using the application implemented in `materials.cpp`

= Implement a unique feature

Implement *at least one* unique feature for your ray tracer. You may implement a 
feature from the ray tracing books, or come up with your own. Below are some 
ideas:

* Support changing the camera position using look at and up vectors
* Add another primitive 
* Lights
* Volumetric effects
* Acceleration data structures
* Focal blur
* Other materials
* Textures
* Post-processing effects (you can use your PPM class for this!)
* Enhance your raytracer so it accumulates samples across multiple frames. This will let the user see the image as it is computed. 

*Be sure to highlight your unique feature in your readme!*

= Create a unique image

Create a unique and interesting scene. Note that you can 
procedurally create pattern and geometry in your scene using curves and formulas 
(same as assignment 2).

Below are some ideas (choose *at least* 4).

* Change the background colors
* Arrange spheres in a snowflake, DNA helix, or fractal pattern
* Arrange triangles to make plutonic solids or other interesting surfaces 
* Use all your primitives

*Important: don't forget to highlight the features you implement in your readme!*

= Update Readme.md

Update `Readme.md` to include documentation on your unique features and images created with your raytracer.

= What to hand in

. Your code. Make sure your code is checked into github
. One or more images created using your software
. Update `Readme.md` so it includes a writeup of the features your application supports. Make sure to include images. Be sure to point out any original features that you implement.
