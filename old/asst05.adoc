**Due Thursday, April 29, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Implement particle systems using point sprites, or billboards

:sectnums:

= Getting started

Fork the repository at https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS312-2021/particles

Follow the instructions in `Readme.md` to build and run the code.

= Getting started

You are given basecode for rendering quads with textures. The basecode uses

* link:https://www.khronos.org/files/opengl4-quick-reference-card.pdf[OpenGL] 
* link:https://github.com/g-truc/glm/blob/master/manual.md[GLM math library] 

= Billboards

Edit the shader `billboard.vs` to draw a billboard. Your billboard should be

* centered at the position `uOffset`
* scaled to match `uSize`
* rotated to point towards `uCameraPos`

To get started, run the program implemented in `main-billboard.cpp`. This program uses the class 
`Renderer` to draw a single billboard using the shader `billboard.vs` and `billboard.fs`.

On windows

[source]
----
build $ ../bin/Debug/billboard.exe 
----

and on mac

[source]
----
build $ ../bin/billboard

When you run this program, you should see

image::A05/billboard-start.png[]

This program implements a billboard as a quad with vertices at (0,0,0),
(1,0,0), (1,1,0), and (0,1,0). It textures the quad using the image `particle.png`.

After you implement the position and scale (do not multiply by uVP yet), you should see

image::A05/billboard-scale-offset.png[]

Next, apply the view-projection matrix to the billboard position. You should see

image::A05/billboard-norot.gif[]

The camera is rotating around the billboard, but the image does not remain facing the camera.
Compute and apply a rotation matrix in your shader that points the billboard towards the 
camera (Hint: use cross products). Once working, you should see

image::A05/billboard-rot.gif[]

= Confetti

In `confetti.cpp`, implement a particle system with the following features

* The initial position of each particle is randomly within a unit cube 
** Hint: use the function `random_unit_cube` defined in `AGLM.h`
* The colors of each particle is randomized
* The velocities of each particle is randomized
* The size of each particle is 0.25
* The particles should stay within a cube with minimum point (-1,-1,-1) and maximum point (1,1,1)

Walkthrough and hints:

* The particle system, `Confetti`, overrides the abstract class ParticleSystem, defined in `particlesystem.h`. Subclasses must override `createParticles` and `update`. The base class contains the renderer and performs drawing each frame.
* The main application is implemented in `main-confetti.cpp`
* In the function `Confetti::createParticles`, 
** load the particle texture with the code `mTexture = theRenderer.loadTexture("../textures/particle.png");`
** initialize the list of particles based on the size. The baseclass manages its list of particles using `std::vector mParticles`. Use the function `push_back` to add particles to `mParticles`
* In the function `Confetti::update`, update the position of each particle based on its velocity. 
** If the position goes out of the bounds [-1,1], reflect the velocity 

At this point, you should see the following with a single particle (edit `confetti-main.cpp` to initialize the system to have 1 particle). 

image::A05/confetti-single.gif[]

With 500 particles, you should see

video::A05/confetti-nosort.mp4[]

Notice all the black, square edges. This occurs because our particles are not drawn from back to front 
in relationship to the camera. The blending cannot work correctly if the particles are not sorted. To fix this, 
you should also sort the particles in `update`.

* You can call `theRenderer.cameraPosition()` to get the camera position.
* You can use a _sorting shortcut_ which takes advantage of the fact that particles do not shift too much between frames (called _spatial and temporal coherency_). In this approach, go through the list once, compare consecutive particles, and swap if one particle should be in front of another.

// cheap sort
for each particle
   d2 = distance from particle to camera
   d1 = distance from previous particle to camera
   if d2 < d1
      swap(particle, previous particle)

= Unique demo

Implement a unique particle system. Here are some ideas:

* Fire (animated sprites)
* Smoke plume
* Fireworks
* Sparkle trailing effect 

* Implement your particle system as a subclass of `ParticleSystem` in `myparticlesystem.h/cpp`
* Test your particle system in `main-demo.cpp`

= Update Readme.md

Update `Readme.md` to include documentation on your unique features and images created with your mesh-viewer.

= What to hand in

. Your code. Make sure your code is checked into github
. One or more images created using your software
. Update `Readme.md` so it includes a writeup of the features your application supports. Make sure to include images. Be sure to point out any original features that you implement.
