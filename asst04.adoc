**Milestone 1: Due Thursday, March 2nd, before midnight**

**Milestone 2: Due Thursday, March 16th, before midnight**

**Milestone 3: Due Thursday, March 23rd, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Implement an interactive model viewer with an orbit camera
* Read and display meshes in PLY file format
* Implement blinn-phong materials using shaders
* Try importing your own models, creating a unique scene, adding interactive controls, and/or implementing your own effects and shaders

= Getting started

Fork the repository at {repo}/mesh-viewer

Clone your copy of the repository to your own computer. To build,
don't forget to do an "out of source" build and run `cmake ..` from the `/build` directory!

[source]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:<username>/mesh-viewer.git
$ cd mesh-viewer
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make (or start mesh-viewer.sln) 
$ ../bin/test-ply-mesh (or ../bin/Debug/test-ply-mesh from the developer console in Visual Studio)
$ ../bin/mesh-viewer (or ../bin/Debug/mesh-viewer from the developer console in Visual Studio)
----

NOTE: Your basecode uses the link:https://github.com/g-truc/glm/blob/master/manual.md[GLM math library] 
for vectors, points, and colors (which have types for glm::vec3 and glm::vec4). 

= Mesh viewer

Implement an application that can preview the meshes in the `/models` directory.

image::A04/mesh-viewer.gif[]

*Controls*

* n or N goes to the next model
* p or P goes to the previous model
* Left-click-drag orbits the camera around the model
* Middle-mouse wheel, or SHIFT-left drag zooms in and out

*Features/Requirements*

* When loading a model, your must ensure that the model fits inside in the view volume. In other words, you should scale and translate the model to make sure it fits in the camera's view volume.
* Your model should be rendered with phong-blinn shading by default, although you can add keyboard controls to switch to other rendering styles. 
* Your viewer should support "orbit" camera controls by default, although you can add other types of camera controls as an extension. 
* Your mesh class should be able to load an indexed triangle mesh from a PLY file.
* Your Mesh class should not contain memory errors, such as leaked memory or out-of-bounds buffer read/writes.

= Milestone 1

*Due March 2nd*

The goals of milestone 1 are 

* to load indexed triangle meshes from a PLY file
* to display the mesh in 3D
* to implement an orbit camera that allows us to look at the mesh from different angles
* to preview a series of models loaded from a directory

== PLYMesh class

In the file `plymesh.cpp`, complete the implementation of the `PLYMesh` class. Your class needs to 

* represent triangles as an indexed mesh
* load the PLY file format 
* compute the axis-aligned bounding box for its vertices. An axis-aligned bounding box consists of
** the minimum values of x, y, and z
** the maximum values of x, y, and z
You can compute the minimum and maximum values when you load the PLY file.

For this milestone, the mesh class must implement the following API:

* PLYMesh()
* virtual ~PLYMesh()
* load(const std::string& filename)
* minBounds() 
* maxBounds() 
* numVertices() 
* positions() 
* normals() 
* colors() 
* uvs() 
* numTriangles() 
* indices() 

Feel free to add additional methods as needed. Some of the above vertex attributes, such as normals and texCoords, 
might be unfamiliar to you. We will talk more about these in upcoming weeks. For now, simply read and store these 
quanities. 

*Getting Started*

Your basecode shows you how to implement an indexed mesh using `std::vector` and an existing helper class 
`agl::TriangleMesh`. The helper class implements code that interfaces your specified mesh information with 
the graphics card using OpenGL.

*Testing*

To test your `PLYMesh`, make sure that the test application `test-ply-mesh` can run without errors. 
This test application loads a small PLY file containing a single triangle.

== PLY File Format

Your `PLYMesh` needs to load mesh information from a link:http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ply/[PLY files].
Information about the PLY file format can be found here: link:http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ply/[PLY files].

NOTE: PLY files can store different amounts of data for each vertex. Below, each vertex has a position and normal. But it's 
possible for each vertex to also store additional information, such as UVs (e.g. texture coordinates) and colors. For this assignment, assume that all PLY 
files have positions and normals only.

== 3D View

In the file `mesh-viewer.cpp`, visualize your PLY file in 3D! When you first open `mesh-viewer.cpp`, you will see the following basecode. It is simular 
to what you used in link:asst01.html[Assignment 01].

[source]
----
class MeshViewer : public Window {
public:
   MeshViewer() : Window() {}
   void setup() {
      // Below is an example of how to load a PLYMesh
      mesh.load("../models/cube.ply");
   }

   // Override these methods to respond to user events
   void mouseMotion(int x, int y, int dx, int dy) {}
   void mouseDown(int button, int mods) {}
   void mouseUp(int button, int mods) {}
   void scroll(float dx, float dy) {}
   void keyUp(int key, int mods) {}

   void draw() {
      float aspect = ((float)width()) / height();
      renderer.perspective(glm::radians(60.0f), aspect, 0.1f, 50.0f);
      renderer.lookAt(eyePos, lookPos, up);

      renderer.translate(vec3(0, 0, 0));
      renderer.rotate(vec3(0, 0, 0));
      renderer.scale(vec3(1, 1, 1));
      renderer.mesh(mesh);
   }

protected:
   PLYMesh mesh;
   vec3 eyePos = vec3(10,0,0);
   vec3 lookPos = vec3(0,0,0);
   vec3 up = vec3(0,1,0);
};

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
   MeshViewer viewer;
   viewer.run();
   return 0;
}
----

link:asst01.html[Assignment 01] displayed 2D graphics. In this assignment, we initialize our window for 3D graphics. The methods for responding to 
user input, such as mouse and keyboard, works exactly the same. To get started, try experimenting with the `lookAt()`, `translate()`, `rotate()`, `scale()` 
calls in `draw()`. 

* `lookAt()` changes the camera position and orientation 
* `translate()` applies a translation transformation 
* `rotate()` applies a rotation transformation 
* `scale()` applies a scale transformation 

After this step, you should see a red cube centered on a black screen.

Requirements:

* Your program should center the loaded model at (0,0,0)
* Your program should resize the model so it fits within a 10x10x10 view volume.

== Swapping models

Implement a feature to cycle through all the models in the `/models` directory. You can load all the filenames from the `/models` dorectory using the 
function call `GetFilenamesInDir("../models", "ply")`, which is defined in `osutils.h`.

* Pressing 'n' should show the next model in the list
* Pressing 'N' should show the previous model in the list

After this step, you should be able to scroll through each model. They will all show with a solid color (no shading!):

image::A04/Milestone1.png[]

== Camera controls

Implement orbit camera controls in `mesh-viewer.cpp`. Extend the `MeshViewer` to update the following camera attributes based on the user's input. 

* position
* backward direction
* up direction
* right direction

Using the algorithm from class, you should keep track of the radius, current elevation (up/down angle) and azimuth (left/right angle) to compute the camera's 
position. The forward direction will then be (position - originPos) since the model will be centered at the origin. You can then compute up and right 
using cross products. To move forward and backward, you simply need to change the radius of the sphere. 

[source]
----
x = Radius * sin(Azimuth) * cos(Elevation) 
y = Radius * sin(Elevation)
z = Radius * cos(Azimuth) * cos(Elevation)
----

= Milestone 2

*Due March 16th*

In the previous milestone, the mesh was rendered with a flat color and wireframe. In this milestone, you will implement 
three shaders and augment your `mesh-viewer.cpp` to switch between them.

* the 's' key should cycle to the next shader
* the 'S' key should cycle to the previous shader

In your basecode, you need to load your shaders in `setup()` and then specify the current shader you are using in `draw()`. 

[source]
----
void setup() {
    renderer.loadShader("normals", "../shaders/normals.vs", "../shaders/normals.fs");
    renderer.loadShader("phong-vertex", "../shaders/phong-vertex.vs", "../shaders/phong-vertex.fs");
    // etc
}

void draw() {
    renderer.beginShader("normals"); // activate shader with given name
    // all primitives draw here will use the current shader
    renderer.endShader();
}
----

*Unlit shader* 

In `unlit.vs` and `unlit.fs`, implement vertex and fragment shaders that uses the normals of your mesh to color the surface.
This shader visualizes the normals that were loaded with your PLY file. The color of each pixel is simply the value of the normal at that point.

image::A04/cow-unlit.png[]

*Per-vertex Phong shader* 

In `phong-vertex.vs` and `phong-vertex.fs`, implement vertex and fragment shaders that perform per-vertex phong shading.

image::A04/cow-phong-pervertex.gif[]

*Per-pixel Phong shader* 

In `phong-vertex.vs` and `phong-vertex.fs`, implement vertex and fragment shaders that perform per-vertex phong shading.

image::A04/cow-phong-perpixel.gif[]

= Milestone 3

Add at least two features to your `mesh-viewer.cpp`. 

* Add new PLY files to your viewer. You can use Blender to export PLY files. You can try finding a free model online and converting to PLY, or even create a model of your own! Be sure to credit the artist if you use someone else's work.
* Implement your own shader: you might try toon shading, procedural textures, or color effects
* Try animating the vertices of the model in your vertex shader
* Support textures. Load UV coordinates and pass them to your shader along with an image. 
* Animate the ligh source, or add additional light sources. 
* Load multiple models at once and create a unique scene

Below is the cow with toon shading

== Update Readme.md

Update `Readme.md` to include documentation on your unique features and images created with your mesh-viewer.

= What to hand in

. Your code. Make sure your code is checked into github
. One or more images or gifs created using your software
. Update `Readme.md` so it includes a writeup of the features your application supports. Make sure to include images or videos. Be sure to point out any original features that you implement.
