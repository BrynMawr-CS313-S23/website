= {title}

**Due Thursday, April 27th**

The goals for this project are:

* Explore a graphics project of interest to you
* Expand on skills and knowledge learned during the semester
* Create a portfolio project 

:sectnums:

= Requirements

* Your project should create a piece of software, such as a demo, tool, or game
* Your project should relate to modeling, rendering, or animation
* Your project must have unique aspects and should not directly copy the code of an existing project or tutorial 

Your final grade will be based on

* Git reports, README and presentation
* Whether your demo builds and runs out-of-the-box
* Demonstrated effort and creativity 

= Milestones

* Project idea: *Due April 13th* (Informally, email or slack your idea and github URL to the instructor.)
* Project proposal report/presentation: Due May 6th.
* Final project presentations: Due May 19th.
* Final project submission: Due May 20th

= Project Idea

*Due April 13th*

Email or slack your idea and title to anormoyle@brynmawr.edu along with the github URL for your project.

Your project idea should include:

* Project title/idea
* Github repository for your project
* How will this project be unique from existing demos? 
* Identify the features you plan to implement and a timeline for completing them
** Sort your features into minimum required, good-to-have and stretch 
* Provide references for the algorithms, data structures and/or background math you plan to implement

= Project

*Due April 27th*

Your complete project should consist of:

* Implementation
* Documentation
* Presentation (10 minutes)

== Implementation 

*Due April 27th*

All code and results should be included in your github repository for this project.
You should submit:

* Your code. Make sure your code is checked into github
* Any dependencies needed to run
* At least one or more images or videos created using your software

== Documentation

*Due April 27th*

All documentation should be in your README.md on Github and should include

* A writeup describing the algorithms, data structures, and math behind your project
* Instructions for how to build and run your project. We should be able to reproduce your results
* Summary of results

== Presentation:

*Due April 27th*

* *10 minutes*
* Should summarize the project idea and describe the underlying algorithms, data structures, and underlying math needed for your project. 
* Should summarize the project idea and show your results
* During lecture/lab on Thursday April 27th 


= Project Ideas
